## My process

### Built with

- [React](react.dev) - JS library 
- [Tailwindcss](tailwindcss.com) - CSS Library
- Typescript

### What I learned

I learned the basics of tailwindcss and typescript. More specifically I learned that tailwindcss has a mobile-first philosophy. This is important when working with media queries. The default case is mobile and if you want you adapt your design for bigger screens, you can use prefixes like `sm`, `lg`, `xl`, or `2xl`. Before I read this I was implementing with the desktop as the default case in mind. 

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com) - This of course helped me a lot for tailwindcss as the documentation is very well designed and can be searched easily.
